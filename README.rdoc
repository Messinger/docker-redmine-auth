This software is in an realy early stage, means not complete working!

Planned:

* authenticate against a redmine installation

* check access via repository pathes (push/pull allowed or not)

* a frontend for (Redmine-)Admin managing docker images

and so on. 

But first step: get basic auth fully working.
